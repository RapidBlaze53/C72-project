<p>This was an award for our debate about pollution in the environment, with some people thinking that it would help the world progress, cleaning it later on, while others thought that it would utterly destroy the world if not taken care of right now. It got so heated, to the point where we got first prize in the Inter School Debate on Environment Pollution</p>

<p>We simply played football a lot, practiced a lot, and reached the finals. The opposing team made a lot of fouls, and it went unnoticed, and due to the unfairness of the game, they won and we got second.</p>

<h4>New School Canteen</h4>
<img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities at school instantly. Once a student reaches the school, parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps school keep a record of the students absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's enrollment number or name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always food around are caught in a shorter time span - just after the admin enters login details into this reacker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidental manner and reduced costs.</p>
